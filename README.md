# LayerZero Bridge UI

This project implements a generic UI for bridging Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFTs) on any supported LayerZero mainnet or testnet chain, with any OFT (or OFTAdapter) standard token. It also provides fee and option controls for advanced users.

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
